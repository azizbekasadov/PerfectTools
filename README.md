# PerfectTools

All necessary tools that are used in almost all my apps. Quite interesting to import and handle btw.

All provides **native** tools for iOS & WatchOS programs

### ⚙️ Installation

`PerfectTools` is installed via the official [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/).  

Select `Xcode`>`File`> `Swift Packages`>`Add Package Dependency...`  
and add `https://github.com/azizbekasadov/PerfectTools`.

*The Swift Package Manager (SPM) is now the official way to install `PerfectTools`. The other package managers are now deprecated as of `4.8.0` and won't be supported in future versions.*

### 📖 Documentation
Look through the codebase in the framework. The documentation is still in-progress.
